Note that the models in this folder were used for generating the final report, and as such some of them are loaded into the example notebooks provided in the main directories' readme.

Each model in this folder corresponds to a run that is stored in wandb for full traceability of the reported results, this is why the models have such odd names. Each of the models' names (the word before "sweep") can be searched in the wandb database where the full run's information can be collected including info on loss at every epoch, runtime, and hyperparameters. The links to these wandb reports can be found in the main directories' readme.
