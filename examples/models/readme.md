Note that the models in this folder were used for generating the final report, and as such some of them are loaded into the example notebooks provided in the main directories' readme.

Note that these models' names can be searched on wandb, where you can also find what parameters and architectures they used. The links to the wandb reports where you can find these can also be found in the main directories' readme under `hyperparameter optimization`.
